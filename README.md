# Get BattleTag

 [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/andburn/hdt-plugin-example.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://github.com/andburn/hdt-plugin-example/releases/latest)

Get BattleTag is a plugin for [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker) that allows you to get your current opponent BattleTag.

After installing the plugin, go to 'PLUGINS > Get BattleTag' to copy your opponent's BattleTag to your clipboard.

I'm not familiar with HDT API, so I would appreciate any suggestions. :)
